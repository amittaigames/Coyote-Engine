## NOTE:

This is now an obselete project! I still have it here because I like some of the concepts I came up with, and the way I implemented them.

# Coyote Engine

Coyote Engine is an Open Source Java Game Engine for both beginners and advanced programmers.

## What happened to Yamanu?

Coyote Engine is kind of like Yamanu 3. Yamanu 2 was pretty good, but the rendering techniques weren't as good as they could've been. The framerate wasn't consistent between machines, and there were a bunch of unnecessary methods. Coyote will be completely new, focusing on speed and true cross-platform compatibility.

## What's so cool about Coyote Engine?

The main feature being developed with Coyote is graphic rendering instead of software rendering. Switching over allows the computer to focus on the game logic while the GPU does all of the rendering work seperately. This will be done with OpenGL.

## Wow, your OpenGL code is older than dirt

Yes, I know, but what that does is make sure most computers support the engine. Very few graphics cards do not support old OpenGL. If you don't support the old OpenGL, be sure to read the next question :)

## OpenGL isn't always supported, what then?

One of the cool features of Coyote is the ability to choose between OpenGL and Software rendering. If your graphics card sucks, or if it's so good it doesn't support older OpenGL, you can still play games with Software rendering. And this time, the techniques will be better ;)

## I have a question to ask

Shoot me an email at criminal.jba@gmail.com and I'll try to answer that question the best I can!
